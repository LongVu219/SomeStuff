Actually these fucking mistake make me die at ABC of codeforce
So get rid of them may give me a chance to fight with harder 
BUGABOO (which i am training for)

So i will kill it once forever.Here is the name : 

- Missed some case
+ Pay more concentrate to your solution (most) 
+ Nothing is 100% correct
+ Write checker (in case of you can't this is real challenge)

- Wrong observation (greedy) (stupid thinking)
+ Try checker with backtracking
+ When no proof but u feel it right ==> checker

- Complicated Mind
+ Make sure no pono or msb before any contest al least 1 - 2 days

- Complicated Imple 
+ Try tougher yourself

- Low concentrate
+ Never play night game or sleep after 12h

In average i can solve C in less than 30min ==> ABC took at most 1h then it can be nice contest

Oh i need talk more about overcomplicated, it's a real big issue

issue : u miss see sth simple, so u thing it's hard and then u apply uncommon segtree, flow, bitmask, stupid greedy
and you are fucked =(((( 

so i fight for 1 afternoon and 1 light night and here is result : 

Submission : 14     AC : 7
Total death rate : 85%

So, u overcomplicated thing u dont understand
u are weak in number theory or some bruh bruh lmao greedy
==> keep trying man  


Hmm, a month but u not see improving, it likely you practice not hard enough
but more likely you're doing wrong  
						-is-this-fft-

u need to detect issue, but unfortunately u often detect wrong issue

The key is about your ambition of solving hard problem
Not about amount of time u spend
Not about the number u solve
Not about the hard of editorial u read
But about the way you think

A good measure is no longer good if it become a goal
					- some wise dude i forgot his name-

So I have elaborate some mistake that might lead to bored-uncertain-not-focus-mind
+ Stay up late (even u sleep for 8h) : fatal
+ Pono : very fatal and must stop, many study provided its danger
+ Play a very good game : bad (luckily i can control it)
+ See good movie : ok (we can finish it fast and later)
+ Bad habit (not workout,sleep badly,not drink your energy) : bad
==> stay sharp and dont pretend to read editorial or looking for help
