In biparties graph we call 2 side A and B

A	B
A	B
A	B
A	B
A	B	
	B
	B

See this dude web for better picture and understanding

WLOG, |A| <= |B| we want to creat a perfect match for A (All elem in A match 1 elem in B)
And we need to detect is it possible or not

We iterate all submask of A called S
Then if this inequality hold for All S from 1 -> (1 << |A|) - 1 ==> perfect match or fuck it
|S| = number of active bit in S <= D(S) = number of elem in B have at least 1 edge connect active bit in A
