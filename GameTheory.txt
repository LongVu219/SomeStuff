Sprague – Grundy Theorem : Use for impartial game - a game which have 2 player and 1 go first, every information is visible
Such as Nim...... bốc 1 2 3 viên sỏi, ai bốc cuối thắng :v

Nim 1 pile : 
f(i) = mex(f(i - 1),f(i - 2),f(i - 3)); f(i) > 0 ==> 1 win else 2 win
How about many pile ?

final = f(x1) ^ f(x2) ^ ..... ^f(xn)
if final > 0 ==> 1 win else 2 win
