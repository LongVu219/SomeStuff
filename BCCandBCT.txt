Look at this prob and sol

-Every time we see a (maybe) crit node ==> all node in our stack form a maximal BCC

To build a block cut tree :
- If we found a BCC we may connect "head of BCC" -> fake node -> all remain node

block cut tree can do the following prob : 
- Given a undirected graph, given Q query x y we want to know how many node 
if we delete it then we cant travel from x -> y

Will this be encountered anyway ? Yes it really encountered in icpc
